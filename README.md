Why Use Manual Upload?

âœ… Great for beginners unfamiliar with Git commands

âœ… Useful for quickly adding small files or testing

âœ… Helps understand basic GitHub UI operations

Note: Manual upload is not recommended for large projects or frequent updates. For bigger projects, using Git locally is preferred.
